    <h3>Join No Breaks</h3>
    <p>
      No Breaks is a pretty unique guild. We value personality as much as skill.
      The majority of our members are adults but we welcome everyone. If you are
      interested in joining the raiding team, there is a two week trial period
      to see how everyone gets along. If all goes well, you'll be accepted to
      join the raid team! (We love our casual players, too!)
    </p>
    <p>The officers are Konnovar, Nebet, Skarlin, Shdowhuntr, Stormpeaks, Dêathunknown, Veksaryn, and Shadrÿn.</p>
